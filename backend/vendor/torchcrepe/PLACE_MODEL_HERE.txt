TORCHCREPE MODEL INSTALLATION
=============================

1. Download the TorchCREPE full-capacity weights:
   URL: https://github.com/maxrmorrison/torchcrepe/raw/main/torchcrepe/assets/full.pth

2. Save the file as:
   backend/vendor/torchcrepe/full.pth

3. (Optional) If you keep external assets outside the repo you can mirror the file
   to models/torchcrepe/full.pth.

The backend never downloads weights automatically. If the file is missing
an explicit "Model missing: torchcrepe" error is raised.
