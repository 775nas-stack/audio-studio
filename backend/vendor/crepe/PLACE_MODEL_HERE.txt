CREPE FULL MODEL INSTALLATION
=============================

1. Download the official full-capacity CREPE weights:
   URL: https://github.com/marl/crepe/raw/master/assets/model-full.h5

2. Place the file at:
   backend/vendor/crepe/model-full.h5

3. (Optional) You may also copy the same file to models/crepe/model-full.h5 if you
   keep external assets outside the repository.

The backend automatically uses the file when present and will emit a
"Model missing: crepe" error if the weight file is absent.
